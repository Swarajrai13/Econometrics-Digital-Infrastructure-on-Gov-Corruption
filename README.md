# Econometrics-Digital-Infrastructure-on-Gov-Corruption
This repository contains the code, data, and supporting documentation for an empirical political economy analysis examining how digital infrastructure‚Äîproxied by mobile subscriptions‚Äîinfluences corruption globally, leveraging panel regression methods and data from the World Bank (WGI, CPIA, WBL).

Using panel regression models and data from 176 countries between 2011 and 2021, the study investigates how mobile technology interacts with demographic, institutional, and infrastructural mechanisms to influence corruption outcomes.

***Dataset Note: Corruption Data Distinction***

This project uses two separate corruption measures, each with unique properties and sample coverage:

**(1) CPIA Corruption Score (cpi_score):**

Source: World Bank CPIA

Range: 1 (worst) to 6 (best)

Coverage: Only low- and middle-income countries

Institutional focus, based on expert assessments tied to aid allocation.

**(2) WGI Control of Corruption (corruption_control):**

Source: Worldwide Governance Indicators

Range: ‚àí2.5 (worst) to +2.5 (best)

Coverage: All countries, including high-income

Perception-based, drawn from survey and expert data.

Both are used to cross-validate the findings under varying assumptions and country samples. The WGI models are especially important due to their broader global coverage and robustness under region-year fixed effects.
