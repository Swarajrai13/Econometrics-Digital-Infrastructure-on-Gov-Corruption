# Econometrics-Digital-Infrastructure-on-Gov-Corruption
This repository contains the code, data, and supporting documentation for an empirical political economy analysis examining how digital infrastructure—proxied by mobile subscriptions—influences corruption globally, leveraging panel regression methods and data from the World Bank (WGI, CPIA, WBL).

Using panel regression models and data from 176 countries between 2011 and 2021, the study investigates how mobile technology interacts with demographic, institutional, and infrastructural mechanisms to influence corruption outcomes.
